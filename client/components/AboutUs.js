      <h5>Why We Built T R A M</h5>
        <p className='about_tram'>Salt Lake City is infamous for its inversion each winter. 
          Ski Resorts and signs on the freeway are always yelling at us to "Carpool! Clean the Air!". 
          But neither provide a source for people to find others to carpool with. 
          So we took this issue, added our love of the mountains, and built T R A M. 
          An app that provides the connection for like minded individuals to come together. 
          With T R A M, any user with a car can create a ride that other users can join. 
          The driver picks the destination, whether it be to one of the Ski Resorts in the Cottonwood Canyons, 
          or to a trailhead to hangout in the backcountry. Our goal is to bring people together and hopefully
          do our part in keeping Utah's air clean.</p><br />

              <br />
              <div className='center paragraph'>
                <p className='center paragraph'>Nathan grew up in the Pacific Northwest, skiing and hiking regularly in the Cascade and Olympic Mountains. This love of the mountains brought Nathan to Salt Lake, in order to be closer to the mountains and ski better snow. As a former middle school science teacher, Nathan has always had a curious side to him and this curiosity led him to tinkering with HTML and CSS. After a couple months of building basic websites, the fire was lit and Nathan's interest in programming led him to DevPoint Labs, to learn all that he could in order to become a web developer. When not programming, you can find Nathan walking his dog with his wife or heading up Little Cottonwood in search of fresh powder.</p>
